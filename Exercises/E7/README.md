# Exercise 7-1: Pointers

For this assignment, you will need to download the starting code located in 'graph.c'. Then you will construct code to find the shortest path between two points on the graph.

Your code should print out the number distance of the path and the nodes it went through to find it.

The code included in graph.c constructs the graph for you, and that is what will be used to test your code.

Keep in mind to reference parts of structs you use the struct variable and then what you want from that struct. 

For example if I want the name of node a and store it in a variable named var: char var = a.name;
