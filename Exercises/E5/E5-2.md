# Exercise 5-2: Arrays

Given an array. Separate the array into Evens and odds. Store them into separate arrays.

Use the array:

```
int numArr[10] = {10, 22, 11, 43, 1, 0, 9, 98, 5, 6}
```

You must store these values into their respective arrays.

Sample Output:

```
Even Array numbers:
2, 32, 4

Odd Array numbers:
21, 3, 7, 9


```
